The name of my solution is Career ai. The app helps you practice interviews with AI, build resumes that actually get past those annoying automated screening systems, and provides personalized learning pathways.     


[THE PROBLEM]
Here's the thing, most people don't realize that before a human even looks at your resume, it goes through an ATS — an Applicant Tracking System — which is basically a robot that scans for keywords. If your CV isn't optimized, it gets rejected automatically. You could be the perfect candidate and still get filtered out. Plus, there's no way to really practice interviews without bothering your friends or family, and even then, they probably don't know what a real interviewer would ask for that specific role. That's the gap I wanted to fill.
 
 
[DEMO: CV BUILDER]
This is how the app works . You go through a step-by-step process — enter your personal info, add your work experience, education, skills, certifications, all that. With the use of the ai , the app gets the role you're targeting, like "Software Developer" or "Retail Assistant," and the AI generates content that's optimized for ATS systems. It gives you the option to either download what you inputted or the ATS developed CV.

[DEMO: AI INTERVIEW COACH]
Next is the AI Interview Coach. I named her Thrive. When you open the app and tap "Start Interview Practice," you first tell Thrive what role you're applying for. Once you hit start, it looks and feels like an actual video call — there's a timer running, Thrive’s avatar on screen. She asks you questions that are specific to that role. Not generic stuff like "tell me your weakness" but real questions you'd get in that industry. You can type your answer or, and this is the cool part, you can speak your answer using voice recognition. The app transcribes what you say in real time. Thrive can also read the questions out loud using text-to-speech for that realistic feel. After each answer, you get instant feedback — a score out of 100, what you did well, and what you need to improve. It scores you on structure, use of examples, and how relevant your answer was to the role. After five questions, you get a full performance report.

[DEMO: LEARNING FEATURES]
The third big feature is the Learning section. It's got three parts. First, there's AI Learning Resources — you can search for any skill, like Python, Excel, or public speaking, and the app gives you curated videos, online courses, articles, and even project ideas to help you actually learn and build a portfolio. Second, there's Skill Assessment, where you can rate your current abilities and the AI tells you where the gaps are and what to focus on and also suggests learning pathways for you. Third, there's an AI Mentor Chat where you can just ask career questions — stuff like "Should I learn React or Angular?" or "How do I negotiate a higher salary?”. It's like having a mentor available 24/7.
